# This is the config file for ExtraChannels

# The name and associated data of every channel is stored in channels.yml. You can create, edit and delete channels directly in the file
# but I recommend that you use the ingame commands for this, as a single misplaced space in the file can cause the entire plugin to fail. 

# If you ever have problems with players not getting the right channels or something like that, a quick /ec reload
# will probably help. This not only reloads the contents of this file but also manually updates the internal storage where
# the plugin keeps track of which players have acces to which channels. If this doesn't fix it, feel free to message me on spigot and
# I will try to fix the problem and update the plugin.
